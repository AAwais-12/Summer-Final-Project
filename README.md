# Summer-Final-Project
This project uses U.S. Census data to build a machine learning model that predicts whether an individual earns over $50K per year based on their demographic and work-related attributes. The goal is to explore the full ML pipeline - from preprocessing to evaluationâ€”using models like Logistic Regression and Random Forest.
